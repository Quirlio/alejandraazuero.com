                    em global
                    span &nbsp;criminal trial. Against the commonly accepted notion that legal aesthetics are subordinated to legal expertise, the book manuscript shows how the practice of designers working for U.S. intelligence agencies shaped the legal project of international criminal justice. Furthermore, it demonstrates how this newly designed forum of global justice rested on a double aesthetic movement: visualizing the Nazi political system through films and charts, while carefully staging the presence of the individually accused inside the courtroom. Organized into four chapters, the study redefines how we understand the making of legal knowledge. It shows that forensics is a design and aesthetic practice that creates the subjects and objects of punishment under criminal law – in this case the representation of Nazi political organization as a criminal conspiracy.

                  em Forensics of Finance: Colombia’s Experiments in Transitional Liberalism
                  span , is an ethnography that shows how the alignment of finance and forensic expertise shaped the project of political transition after the peace agreement between the state and Colombia’s Revolutionary Armed Forces (FARC), one of the oldest insurgent organizations in the world. It argues that the transformation of Colombia’s forensic knowledge production practices in preparation for the signing of the peace agreement recalibrated both the meaning of legal accountability and the project of political transition, thus creating new categories of criminality that then became the subject of criminal prosecution. Moreover, it demonstrates that this happened primarily through a mode of forensic knowledge centered on integrating financial risk analysis methodologies into the state’s prosecutorial apparatus. This experiment, in turn, led to a rise to prominence of finance as an object of forensic knowledge and source of criminal liability capable of exposing all types of social wrongs, from war crimes to corruption.
